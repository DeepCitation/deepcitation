# Basic Verification Example

A minimal example demonstrating the DeepCitation 3-section workflow for verifying AI citations against attachments.

## What This Example Does

1. **Install & Setup**: Uploads a sample document and prepares sources for citation verification
2. **Server Side**: Wraps prompts, calls your LLM, and verifies all citations against the source document
3. **Display**: Shows verification results with status, matched text snippets, and summary statistics

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment file and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env

# Run with OpenAI
bun run start:openai

# Or run with Anthropic Claude
bun run start:anthropic

# Or run with Google Gemini
bun run start:gemini

# Or run with raw API calls (curl/fetch)
bun run start:curl
```

## Required API Keys

1. **DeepCitation API Key** (free): Get one at [deepcitation.com/signup](https://deepcitation.com/signup)
2. **LLM Provider Key**: Either OpenAI or Anthropic API key

## Example Output

```

## Using Your Own Documents

Replace the sample document buffer in the source file with your own PDF:

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

const myDocument = readFileSync("./path/to/your/document.pdf");

const { fileDataParts, deepTextPromptPortion } = await deepcitation.prepareAttachments([
  { file: myDocument, filename: "my-document.pdf" },
]);
```

## Key Functions Used

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `deepcitation.prepareAttachments()` | Upload documents, get formatted text for LLM |
| `wrapCitationPrompt()` | Add citation instructions to your prompts |
| `deepcitation.verify()` | Parse LLM output and verify all citations (recommended) |
| `deepcitation.verifyAttachment()` | Verify citations against a specific attachment |
| `getCitationStatus()` | Get simplified status (isVerified, isMiss, etc.) |
| `replaceCitationMarkers()` | Replace citation markers with optional verification status |

## Raw API Usage (curl)

The `start:curl` example shows how to call the DeepCitation API directly without the client SDK. This is useful for:
- Integrating with other programming languages
- Understanding the underlying API
- Custom implementations

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Step 1: Upload file
curl -X POST "https://api.deepcitation.com/prepareAttachments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCITATION_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"

# Returns: { "attachmentId": "...", "deepTextPromptPortion": "..." }

# Step 3: Verify citations
curl -X POST "https://api.deepcitation.com/verifyCitations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCITATION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "attachmentId": "YOUR_ATTACHMENT_ID",
      "citations": {
        "1": { "fullPhrase": "exact quote from document", "pageNumber": 1 }
      },
      "outputImageFormat": "avif"
    }
  }'

# Returns: { "verifications": { "1": { "status": "found", ... } } }
```
